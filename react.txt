1.react is all about components and these component are used to reuse the code and optimise the code
component are used for reuablity and for separation of different features of app 

With React.js, you define the "goal" (i.e. what should be shown on the screen) and let React figure out how to get there.

2.components are basically only function of javasrcipt which return a html/jsx code 

3.react is declarative means we write in different components and merge them then react understand
and transform it for us to show on website

4.we should write the components name in first letter in capital case to better understandreact
which are buildin tags and which are own made tags

5.one important rule in jsx return html code return in a component ki only one root elemnt must be return not 
more then that or we only have one root elemnt per return statment

6. for css in react there is nothing special we just create a css file then import that css file 
in which js file ma aap ausko style karna chahata ho
and in react jsx ma class nhi className sa hum define karta hai bcoze class is reserved for js

7.We not all the times use the hard coded value in html to return as we now a component is just 
a function which contains html css and js code jo we can add js code to our component also
{by the help to these bracketts we can all js code to out html jo return ho raha hai} and make 
it dynamic instead of hard-coded values we can inject basic js code with the help of these {bracketts}
return karna sa phele aap upar js ka code likh lo and use kar lo in return jsx code ma with {bracketts}

8.props in react stands for property of the our own build elemnt or custom component and these props are nothing 
they are just attributes of our own build element/component these are needed by us to pass 
to pass dynamic values 

with the help of props we pass data to our custom component with the help of props, we can set property
of our own custom component 

React allow us to pass parameter in component and yaha par hum alag alag parameter pass nhi karta
ek object bana kar props usma all attributes as parameter pass kar dete hai hum 

we can give any name to these our own build attributes but the object key shoud be same which we pass

with the helps of props we can pass data to multiple file and componentin react

9. our component is just a function when react intially evaluate the component then it run 
all the component/function only once and after that any change to variable or other does not 
say react to evaluate the component thats why changing title using equal to does run the
component again  for that to re-evaluate the component we use usestate


10. UseState it is important to understard that changing variable value in our component 
does not effect to re-evaluate the component by react it does not work like that instead 
we need to use useState a react hook which help us to do that useState is a function
which takes a initial default value and return a array of size 2 where 1st is the variable 
and 2nd is the function which is used to update the variable

usestate ka use kara ka hum component function ko again trigger kar sakta hai  react kabhi bhi 
variable change or on click ki vaja sa kabhi bhi nhi re-evaluate nhi kar ta function ko

usestate(take a default variable change in which cause react to re-evaluate the component)

usestate is a function whose change in value triggering re-evaluation of the component

useState register some state so some value as state for the component in which it is called

useState is per component instances basis means if there are multiple instances of a component
the state at one instances does not effect the state of the same component of different instances
they are detacted from one another 

and whenever the click ki vaja sa re-evaluate huga toh for that component only and for that
only instance ka kiya re-evaluate hoga pura code nhi re-evaluate hoga by react

we are using const which fine to use in useState bcoze we are not asigning value by using = 
equal to instead we pass it to set updating function so react will manage variable for us

Calling useState again will simply create a new state.it will not update it create new state

if a state depend on previous state we should use function form to update the state

11. when ever any event occur a event object was there which can be used for many purposes

12. There is a default behaviour of form if there is button of type submit there is a event 
which can be done on form onSubmit 

13.two way binding in react used in form to update the value after form is been sumbmitted
